## Worried about security ?

Your passwords are saved in an encrypted format so even if anyone gets access to the saved password he won't be able to see your passwords, without the use of the command line app. And you won't show them how to use the app, right ?

### Have a look:

All the passwords are stored in an encrypted format.
